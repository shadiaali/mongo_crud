//objects are specified in curly braces
//strings can be put in arrays
//if data is stored in a date format you can do much more query wise
//Eg, using greater than or less than in the query.
//You can also subtract this date from this date and itâ€™ll give you the number, etc.
//It is a lot more efficient than strings. 
//you can nest arrays and objects
